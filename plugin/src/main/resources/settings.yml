  #
  server: Lobby

  #
  # The 'domain' configuration is related to your server's domain and must necessarily match the value set for 'DOMAIN' in the '.env' file located at 'web/docker/.env'.
  # If you are running MelodyMine in a development environment on your localhost, use 'localhost' instead of a domain.
  #
  ### Similar value in the '.env' file in the directory 'web/docker/.env':
  ### DOMAIN= 'domain'
  #
  domain: localhost

  #
  # The 'client_port' configuration is related to the port of the website used by players to connect to the voice feature.

  #
  ### Similar value in the '.env' file in the directory 'web/docker/.env':
  ### CLIENT_PORT= 'client_port'
  #
  client_port: 3000

  #
  # The 'server_port' configuration is related to the websocket server used by the plugin to establish communication with online players on the website client.
  # This value must match the value set for SERVER_PORT in the '.env' file located at 'web/docker/.env'.
  #
  ### Similar value in the '.env' file in the directory 'web/docker/.env':
  ### SERVER_PORT= 'server_port'
  #
  server_port: 4000

  #
  # The 'plugin_key' configuration is related to the MelodyMine authentication system.

#
# When the auto_start config is set to true, upon clicking a link to connect to the voice or scanning a QR code to enter the site,
# the voice starts automatically without the need to click the "Start Melody" button manually.
# If it's set to false, the player must manually click the "Start Melody" button.
#
auto_start: true


#
# Using the 'force_voice' configuration, you can force players on the server to always
# enable online voice chat when playing.
#
force_voice:
  enable: false

  #
  # By setting the 'send_title' configuration to 'true', the title related to force voice will be sent to players.
  # To modify the title text, you can edit the corresponding values in the language file based on the selected language (e.g., en_US.yml).
  # The values you can modify are 'force_voice_title_message' and 'force_voice_subtitle_message'.
  #
  send_title: true

  #
  # You can specify how often forced voice messages such as title, subtitle, and open website link are sent to players using the send_interval config.
  # By default, this value is set to 300, meaning these messages are sent every 15 seconds (10L = 0.5s, 20L = 1s, ...).
  #
  send_interval: 300

  #
  # If the damage config is set to true, players are in a forced voice state and haven't entered the voice chat yet,
  # they won't take any damage. However, if it's set to false, they're in the default state and will take damage.
  #
  damage: false



#
# By setting the 'enable' configuration to 'true',
# players who are online in voice chat can mute or unmute themselves on the website using the shortcut ('Shift' + 'F').
#
mute_toggle_shortcut:
  enable: true

  #
  # Using the cool_down config, you can define the cool down between toggling mute and unmute, which is set to 1000ms (1s) by default.
  #
  cool_down: 1000


#
# The 'call_pending_time' configuration determines the time duration for which players remain in a pending call state, awaiting responses.
# By default, this option is set to '600', which equals '30s'.
# You can adjust this time as per your preference using (10L = 0.5s, 20L = 1s, ...).
#
call_pending_time: 600


#
# All configurations related to sounds,which allow you to adjust the sounds players hear,
# are activated when a player enables 3D Sound on the website.
#
sound_configs:

  #
  # The 'hear_lazy' configuration determines the behavior when a player disables the 3D Sound mode.
  # When set to 'true', sounds are played in a lazy manner, meaning they are less intense and clear as the player moves away.
  # Conversely, when set to 'false', sounds are played at full volume within the 'max_distance' set, regardless of the player's position.
  #
  hear_lazy: true

  #
  # The 'max_distance' configuration sets the maximum distance within which players can interact and communicate with each other.
  # By default, it is set to '15', meaning that when two players are within a distance of 15 units, they can hear each other's voices simultaneously.
  #
  max_distance: 15

  #
  # The 'ref_distance' configuration is applied when a player enables 3D Sound on the website.
  # This distance determines that if two players are within this range of each other, they will hear each other's voices at maximum volume and clarity.
  # As the distance increases, the sound gradually decreases.
  #
  ### Note: It is essential to ensure that the 'ref_distance' configuration is always less than the 'max_distance'.
  #
  ref_distance: 5

  #
  # You can adjust the speed of sound attenuation between players using the rolloff_factor config, meaning the higher the rolloff_factor,
  # the faster the sound reaches the player, and the lower the rolloff_factor, the slower the sound reaches them.
  #
  rolloff_factor: 1

  #
  # Using the 'inner_angle' configuration, you can specify the inner angle (face-to-face) of the player, ranging from 0 to 360 degrees.
  # In this scenario, when a player is within this angle of another player, they will hear the other player's voice as if they are facing them directly.
  # As the angle decreases, the player must be closer to facing the other player's front to hear their voice clearly, and vice versa.
  #
  inner_angle: 120

  #
  # Using the 'outer_angle' configuration, you can determine the outer angle (back-to-back) of the player, ranging from 0 to 360 degrees.
  # In this setup, when a player is within this angle of another player, they will hear the other player's voice as if they are facing away from them.
  # As the angle decreases, the volume of the voice coming from behind the player increases, and vice versa.
  #
  outer_angle: 180

  #
  # With the 'outer_volume' configuration, you can adjust the volume of the sound that a player hears when another player is within the 'outer_angle'.
  # The higher the volume value, the louder the sound players will hear when someone is behind them, and vice versa when the value is lower.
  #
  outer_volume: 0.3


#
# The 'renew_configs' configurations are related to updating the locations of players from the Minecraft server to the website, where the players are online.
# One of the most crucial aspects is ensuring attention to detail when configuring this setting.
#
### IMPORTANT NOTE: (max-distance < connect-distance < volume-distance < disconnect-distance)
#
renew_configs:

  #
  # The 'renew_interval' configures how often player data is sent towards the website, measured in seconds. By default, it is set to '30', which equals '1.5s'.
  # You can adjust this interval using the algorithm (10L = 0.5s, 20L = 1s, ...) according to your preferences.
  #
  interval: 30

  #
  # The 'connect_distance' configuration facilitates the connection between players for hearing each other's voices.
  # When players are within this distance from each other, they establish a connection on the website and can hear each other.
  # If the value of 'connect_distance' is equal to the value of 'max_distance', they will hear each other's voices. However, if 'max_distance' is shorter,
  # they will only hear each other's voices when they are within the distance set by 'max_distance'.
  #
  ### IMPORTANT NOTE: 'connect_distance' value must always be equal to or greater than 'max_distance',
  # and either smaller or equal to the value of 'volume_distance'. Also, 'disconnect_distance' should be set to a greater than 'connect_distance'.
  #
  connect_distance: 15

  #
  # The 'volume_distance' configuration is used to update the volume of players relative to their location in the Minecraft server.
  # This configuration must always be equal to or greater than the 'connect_distance' and smaller than the 'disconnect_distance'.
  #
  volume_distance: 30

  #
  # The 'disconnect_distance' configuration is for disconnecting players on the website when they move away from each other beyond a certain distance after being connected.
  # If players move outside this distance from each other, they will be disconnected on the website.
  # This value must always be greater than 'disconnect_distance', 'connect_distance', and 'max_distance'.
  #
  disconnect_distance: 80


#
# You can specify the worlds where you want to disable voice chat using the 'disable_worlds' configuration.
# Simply enter the names of the worlds you wish to disable voice chat in the list below.
#
disable_worlds:
  - world_nether
#  - "world_the_nether"


#
# Using the 'show_status_type' configuration, you can specify how one of these statuses is displayed to players,
# either as a message in the chat or as an action bar message.
# You can populate each part of the configuration accordingly with 'message' or 'actionbar'.
#
show_status_type:
  join_website: message
  leave_website: message
  start_voice: message
  end_voice: message


#
# You can define the cool down between plugin commands using the commands_cool_down config, which is set to 3000ms (3s) by default.
#
commands_cool_down: 3000
